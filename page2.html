          I found the csv dataset I used hosted on Kaggle (linked
          above) It was assembled by the BFRO (Bigfoot Field
          Research Organization). Included were several datapoints
          on thousands of bigfoot sightings across the U.S. Data
          existed for sightings from the mid-1970s to mid-2010s.
          <br><br>
          The most important thing when working with data in 
          csv (comma-seperated-values) is ensuring the data is
          clean and relevant. All the summarizations, visualizations, 
          and predictions that follow are only as accurate as the raw 
          data. Applying data science principles to the raw csv file 
          presented some unique challenges. Python is the industry 
          standard language for Data Science for good reason, to be 
          objective. This is due to Python libraries like Pandas, 
          Numpy, and Matplotlib. These three combine to offe a suite  
          of functionality that allows devs to fairly easily apply 
          formal statistical methods to datapoints stored in csv 
          format. After loading a csv into a Pandas DataFrame, a dev 
          can read, clean, manipulate, summarize, visualize, and infer 
          data.  
          <br>
          Accomplishing the same functionality with csv data in 
          Javascript is not quite as simple I used the d3 library to 
          read and clean the csv file. Visualizations were made using 
          Chart.js. Though d3.js does offer charting tools, they are 
          rendered as svg files. Chart.js renders charts using an 
          HTML5 canvas which makes it a great option for use with the 
          DOM api. For data prediction, I chose Tensorflow.js, a 
          recognized leader in machine learning and AI functionality. 
          <br><br>
          Below is a description with screenshots of the steps I took 
          to read, clean, summarize, and visualize the data as well as 
          build a neural network to make regressive predictions.
